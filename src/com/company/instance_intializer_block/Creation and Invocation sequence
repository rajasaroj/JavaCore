Timeline) Task
1st) class is loaded
2nd) static initializer are invoked
3rd) Class instance (object) is created at the same time Instance Initalizer Block (IIB) is also created
4th) Now when class A the object is created
   4.1) class A constructor is invoked
   4.2) class A constructor invokes class A_Parent constuctor
   4.3) once the class A_Parent constuctor is executed completely, Instance Initalizer Block (IIB) present in class A is invoked.
   4.4) once Instance Initalizer Block (IIB) present in class A is completed then the remaining statements in class A executed


So Code wise precedence is:

1) Static { /* some code here */ }
2) A() {
       2.1) A_Parent()
       2.2) { /* some code here in IIB */ }
       2.3) /* then all the statements in class A constructor */
    }
