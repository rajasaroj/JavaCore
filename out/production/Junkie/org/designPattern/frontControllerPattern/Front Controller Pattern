Intro: This pattern provides centerlize mechanism for all type of request handling,
       It handles all type of request, along with that it also does
       authetication,
       authoriaztion,
       Request Tracking,
       Request loging.

       After completing above steps it send the request to dispatcher
       The dispatcher does the processing on request param and determines the appropriate view for the request.
       this reduces code duplication and encourages code reusablity.

What problem does this solves:
        let take an example of a online shopping website,
        the online shopping website handles multiple users along with that it has also handle sequence of step from product selection to billing
        and invoce genration all of these step has to handled correctly with security and consistency for all users/customer
        lot of code deplucation can occur in this case, this will led to poor management of code component and might intruduce inconsistency.


how does Front Controller handle the problem in this case:
        1) Front Controller receive the request:
                    - authenticates it.
                    - authorizes it.
                    - tracks it.
                    - log it.
                    - send the request to dispatcher for futher processing.

                    2) dispatcher is called:
                                - it parses the request param.
                                - processes them and detemines the appropriate view for the request.

                                3) Correct view is called.
